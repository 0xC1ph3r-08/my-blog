##  2025

### May 2025
- Solved the CTF challenge in PICOCTF.
- Solved the LEVEL-00 & LEVEL-01  Ethernaut challenges.
- Participated in the Tsukuctf 2025 online competition with my HACKERTROUPE team, where we secured 87th position overall and 49th in the General Category. While I didn't contribute directly to the team's score this time, it was a valuable learning experience that has motivated me to focus more intently on cryptography within CTFs through dedicated practice.
- Solved the `guess my cheese part1 challenge` in the PICOCTF in the category of cryptography .
